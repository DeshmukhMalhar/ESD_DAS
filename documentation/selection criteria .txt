ESD Data Acquisition System :
Problem Statement:
	Ddesign a Data Acquisition System to Display and transfer data to a PC over a serial link.
	The data to be gathered is 
		Weight of objects, ranging from 0-20kg,with resoluation of 100g
	and,
		Pressure in range ___-___ ___ , with resoluation of _____ ___
	
Solution :
	
	Selecting a microcontroller:
		Requirements :
			ADC, at least 8bit
			USART or timer or H/w interrupts for serial communication
			At least 10 GPIOs,
				6 for HD77480 LCd (16X02)
				2 for Serial communication
				1 for weight measurement
				1 for Pressure sensor
				
		THERE ARE DIFFERENT APPROACHES HERE, TO SELECT A MICROCONTROLLER
		THE MAJOR FORCE DRIVING ANY NORMAL DESIGN IS THE COST.
		IF YOU CAN MAKE THE DESIGN COST LESS BY RS10, YOU SAVE MMILLIONS IN A LONG RUN
		
		THUS , THE CHALLANGE HERE IS TO FIND A MICROCONTROLLER WHICH WILL NOT CONPROMISE OUR ANALOG SPEC, 
		BUT,
		
		HAS ALL THE ANALOG SIGNAL CONDITIONING BUILT IN,
		IS GOING TO BE OUR BEST CHOICE
		
		
	
	As a differential amplifier is required to get readings from the Strain Gauge for Weight measurement,
		and "ATTINY84A" mcu has a differential ADC built in
		
		which costs RS66 in 1-off quantities, eliminating need of seperate
		differential ADC , which normally cost in the range fo RS80 to RS180 alone,
			
			a microcontroller with a built in differential ADC is , while
			costing less than only the amplifier, helps in cutting the cost of the design
			
			The ADC also HAS a gain selection in differential mode
			
	Next BIG advantage by going with ALL-IN-ONE solution is saving of the layout space,
		thus, 
		PCB size gets reduced,
		PCB cost gets reduced.
		
		ATTINY84A is avaliable in packge QFN20 with size 3mmX3mm results in smaller and smaller PCB
